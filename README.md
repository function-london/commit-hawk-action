### WHY?

Watching a repository on GitHub tells you about social activity (e.g. PRs, issues, etc.), but it doesn't notify you about file-level changes that you and your team might care about. 

For example, when an external vendor merges in their work, or when a critical part of the codebase is changed, or when new dependencies are added, etc 

Commit Hawk Action fills that gap. 

## Usage

Install the [Incoming Slack Webhook](https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks) app to your Slack workspace. Reference that webhook URL in `slack_webhook_url` param in your action's yml as shown below.

Actions can be setup to run conditionally when a specific file(s) on a particular branch are changed. 

The `paths` keywords accept glob patterns that use the * and ** wildcard characters to match more than one path name. For more information, see the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpaths).

```yaml
name: hawk
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - '/some/important/file'

jobs:
  hawk:
    name: hawk
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: CommitHawk
      uses: jesalg/commit-hawk-action@v1.1
      with:
        slack_webhook_url: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/XYZ'
        slack_message: 'Contents of some important file were changed on main'
        # Comma separated list of author usernames to filter commits by. Filter will not run if argument is empty
        username_whitelist: 'USER_A,USER_B'
```
